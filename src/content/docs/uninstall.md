title: Uninstalling Atuin
---

Sorry to see you go!

Uninstalling Atuin depends on your system, and how you installed it. Wherever possible, our install script will use your system package manager.

EG, on macOS, you'd want to run

```
brew uninstall atuin
```

There is also a shell integration that you will need to remove from your shell config file. Find the line referencing `atuin init` , and remove it.
